This application will build a matrix of (n,m)-size with k-colors.
First we need to input our columns and rows range with number boxes. The matrix should generate on change!
There is another window with the list of usable colors, you can add color to the list with the default palette or
with a custom color that you have picked (Hexadecimal and RGB code could be used).
Then you just have to click on a color in the list and click on the matrix in order to build your pattern.

This application can export your pattern as a :
Python Matrix in .txt, .json file or even an image (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .svg, .pdf)
Tabler (.csv, .xls, .xlsx)
Pattern image (.jpg, .jpeg, .png with white background, .png w/out background, .svg, .pdf)
