About Pattern Builder :

Pattern Builder was a side project that I had to develop in order to return a Python array that would be used as a
"pattern".

This application is fully developed with Python programming language. You can access, read and download all files on
my GitHub !

If you ever want to help in order to enhance Pattern Builder application efficiency or its core code, feel free to
open an issue or a merge request on the GitHub repository.

if you have more questions about this application, you can contact me with this email address :
